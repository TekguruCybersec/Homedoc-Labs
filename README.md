# Homedoc Labs

# Overview

 HomeDoc Labs is a mission-driven web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that brings accessible, sustainable healthcare services to users' doorsteps. It allows users to book at-home doctor consultations, lab tests, and rent medical   devices like Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM) and Blood Pressure Machines at discounted rates. What makes it unique is its alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically:
    
    üçÄ SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being ‚Äì Promoting preventive care and early detection.
    üçÄSDG 10: Reduced Inequalities ‚Äì Offering subsidies and discounts for underserved communities.
    üçÄ SDG 13: Climate Action ‚Äì Encouraging home-based services to reduce carbon emissions, with CO2 savings trackers.

This project serves as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for a holistic health platform, incorporating gamification (badges for health goals), AI preliminary analysis (simulated), and community features.
